                    <p>My name is Paris DeMille. I am from Monroe, UT and enjoy the outdoors immensely. Although I do have a passion for finance and technology (fintech), I wanted to use
                        this platform to showcase my passion in photography and traveling instead. Currently, I enjoy traveling the American southwest and the Pacific Islands. Capturing
                        the unique places I've been or moments with my friends doing adrenaline pumping stunts is a bonus!  
                    </p>

                    <p>As of recently, we traveled to Oahu, Hawaii and Phoneix, AZ. In Oahu, we were fotunate enough to go to North Shore and go cliff jumping off of a 60 ft rock and swim
                        among bioluminescent plankton at night. In Arizona, the experience was drastically differet. We traveled to various Native American Reservations and capture obscure
                        slot canyons and free climbed parts of the famous Havasupai Waterfalls.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the near future, I hope to travel through Asia. Idealistically, heading from India through Tibet, and then moving onto
                        South East Asia would deliver amazing experiences.
                    </p>
